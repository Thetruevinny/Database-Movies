# Codecademy project - Created Movies Database with PostgresSQL
## Goal
The goal was to create a relational database with multiple linked tables.
## Description
The database contains 6 tables: movies, actors, directors, studios, movies_actors, movies_directors. I decided to keep the movies to studios a one to many relationship so that I could include this type of relationships in my db. I understand this does not model the real life scenario. The table has been created with suitable constraints, indexes and roles.
