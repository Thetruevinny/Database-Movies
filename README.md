A codecademy project - created a Movies Database with postgresSQL. The database contains 6 tables: movies, actors, directors, studios, movies_actors, movies_directors. I decided to keep the movies to studios one to many relationship so that I could include on of these type of relationships in my db. I understand this does not model the real life scenario. The table has been created with suitable constraints, indexes and roles.
